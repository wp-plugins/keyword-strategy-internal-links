The Keyword Strategy Internal Links plugin will automatically link keywords to destination pages within your website.

== Description ==

The purpose of the Keyword Strategy Internal Links plugin is to automatically connect keywords with destination pages within your website. For example, you can make the first instance of the word "widgets" on any page become an automatic link to your /widgets/ page.

Building internal links helps users stay on your site, as they can reference background material. It also improves your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, as it lets the search engines find and rank some of your deeper webpages.

1. Upload the `keyword-strategy-internal-links` directory into `/wp-content/plugins`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter your keyword strategy profile information on the Keyword Strategy Internal Links plugin settings page to connect to your account.
4. Click "Update Now" to download your keyword/URL data.
5. Check your website to make sure that the links you specify in your Keyword Strategy account are reflected in the HTML of your website.
