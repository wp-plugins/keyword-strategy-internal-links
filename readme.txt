== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Keyword Strategy? =

Keyword Strategy is a web-based tool that assists you with your search engine optimization efforts. It helps you find keywords, track your rank in the search engines, organize your internal and external links, and much more. You can find out more information by going to:

= Why do you need a Keyword Strategy account for this plugin? =

One of the features of Keyword Strategy is that it automatically detects what pages on your website are the best match for various keywords for search engine optimization. The data for the Internal Links plugin comes from the user's account at Keyword Strategy. So if you haven't organized your links in your account, there's no way for us to know which keywords will link to which URLs on your website.

= What happens if I close my Keyword Strategy account? =

The Keyword Strategy tool is necessary to manage the internal links. If you shut down your Keyword Strategy account, the links will remain on your site, but you won't be able to change them. Eventually you'll probably want to replace this plugin with something different.
